### Day 3: July 30, 2017
##### Exercises finished!!

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed HTML documentation. I completed all my Bootcamp exercises for the week, now can continue with my JS studies. 

**Thoughts**: It's hard to conciliate days off with my demmanding objectives. I also try not to overwhelm with the 8,000 coding languages and new technologies, all present in the market. My tech debt is big, since I studied Communications. Fortunately, I always felt kind of connected to the tech world. As a Journalist, my inclusion to the coding field has been natural and gradual, something I really appreciate.


### Day 2: July 29, 2017
##### My first Coding Bootcamp day

**Today's Progress**: First Bootcamp Day. I got my Atom completly set up. It's been a great idea to enroll to the course two months ago, because I had enough time to read. I have a commitment: work every single day in coding. And so do I, I have a couple of months work and I am enjoying every headache. 

**Thoughts**: I wanted to discard those fancy hampering templates and pluggins for my text editor. I guess I have all I need now. I get new advise from my mentors. Training my Frustration Muscle, it's still a beginner!! 
I changed my keyboard to EN.


### Day 1: July 28, 2017
##### Working on porfolio.

**Today's Progress**: HTML, CSS and JS included in Contact section for my personal porfolio.

**Thoughts:** I have to check the JS file again. The background is supposed to do some creative things when the mouse passes over the section. No new behavior shown.
